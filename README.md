I'm currently a Senior majoring in CS & DS @ UW-Madison with a CS GPA of 3.95 + 3x Dean's List Award.
I started learning about CS around end of 2019 when COVID started and has never stopped since.
I love hooping and acting like I am Steph Curry, but for most part, I write code and build stuff that I think real human will want to use it

I've used Python nearly everyday since 2020, I started both using Python and Java around the time when I started college.
I started using C about 18 months ago in CS354 class at UW-Madison. I become really fluent in C after completing the class
in UW-Madison where most of the CS students fear, Operating System. After building a shell (terminal) and file system in XV6 for
the projects in class, I honestly can write C with my eyes closed.

I started learning CS during COVID year building an E-commerce for my brother. I used only PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, Jquery, and
Javascript to built a fully function website for my brother that allowed him to run his business. I hosted the website
on Hostinger. The web application actually generated more than 20$ usd in a year! I am working on pushing the code to my github but because
it's a cooperate codebase, I can not just push it. Here's a link to view the website when it was alive (2020 - 2024)

### about me
I was born in Klang, Selangor, Malaysia in an average Malaysian Chinese household of 4 (before me).
My parents and my brothers were all middle-school dropouts and can barely speak English.
I grew up as the last child until I was 10 (damn it younger sister but I love you still).
My family was blessed with some money after I was born and with my focus on education,
I was able to be the first in my entire family tree to receive tertiary education. And 
here I am, hooping and writing code everyday hoping someday I will make a positive impact to
the world and pay my family back!

My hobby: Basketball, watching football (got into it recently)
My favorite NBA team: None because I only admire players, Stephen Curry and Lebron James!
My favorite NFL team: Packers (partly because I go to school at UW-Madison)
